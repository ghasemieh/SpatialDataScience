# SpatialDataScience

Spatial data science allows analysts to extract deeper insight from data using a comprehensive set of analytical methods and spatial algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning techniques [https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/5d76dcf7e9ccda09bef61294/spatial-data-science%3A-the-new-frontier-in-analytics/][1]. 



Thi The motive of this course is make you aware of spatial data elements and getting hands dirty in PyQGIS. PyQGIS bindings depend on SIP and PyQt4. Python bindings for Qt (PyQt) are done also using SIP and this allows seamless integration of PyQGIS with PyQt.

There are several ways how to use Python bindings in QGIS desktop, they are covered in detail in the following sections:

automatically run Python code when QGIS starts
issue commands in Python console within QGIS
create and use plugins in Python
create custom applications based on QGIS API
QGIS can be downloaded from https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
